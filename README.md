# forge-extras
Extra content for Forge that we don't want in the main repo (decks, etc) and is not intended to be user downloaded and installed manually from this github.

Most of this content is downloaded using the file tools in forge settings. For the decks content please use the "Net Decks" selection in the deck manager dropdown.

While it is not intended for this data to be downloaded manually from this github page, you can extract most files to their appropriate folder in the forge cache folder (fonts, skins, sounds) and all-prices.txt goes into the "db" folder.

Extracted Deck files (.dck) to the deck directory in forge's user data folder keeping in mind the appropriate sub directory for the deck type.
